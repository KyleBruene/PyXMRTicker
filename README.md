# PyXMRTicker
A desktop XMR Price ticker made with python3

Warning! I'm in the middle of learning Python and made this thing while I was bored. If you are an experienced python programmer please do point out
my mistakes, that would help me improve this. 

Python3 packages required to run this script -->

- tkinter
- urllib.request
- ast


I'm pretty sure the last 2 come pre-installed with Python but you may need to install tkinter. 

Thanks for checking out my little project, here. I hope to improve it as my knowledge of python and monero increase.
